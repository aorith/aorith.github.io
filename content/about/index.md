Hola! I'm Manuel, a tech enthusiast with a diverse background. From SysAdmin to DevOps engineer, I've evolved into someone who loves to code. While I occasionally use Go, my usual tools of choice are Python and shell scripts.

This transition allowed me to bridge the gap between development and operations, harnessing the power of automation and continuous integration.

### Containers

Containers have become the backbone of scalable, portable, and efficient applications. I work with containers daily, harnessing the power of Docker/Podman and container orchestration tools to ensure seamless deployment and management of software applications.

### Exploring NixOS and Immutable Systems

Lately, my interest has been piqued by NixOS and immutable systems. The idea of declarative, reproducible infrastructure and systems management has ignited my curiosity.

### The Lifelong Quest for Knowledge

In the fast-paced tech world, one thing remains constant: the need to keep learning and stay updated on new technologies. It's an ever-changing landscape, and I'm committed to continuous learning.

### Free Time

Besides technology, I'm all about hiking and outdoor adventures, finding solace in nature. Back home, I like to play Metroidvania games and watch a good movie.
