Hola! I'm Manuel, a DevOps engineer from Spain. My career in IT began with a basic job in technical support. Even then, I was fascinated by Linux. It gave me the freedom to set up my computer exactly how I wanted. I especially enjoyed working with the command line and learning about the [UNIX philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), where all the pieces fit together.

Soon, I moved up to a level 2 support role. This was a big step for me, as I got to work closely with UNIX systems and solve more complex problems for systems and applications.

Meanwhile, I was already tinkering with programming. I began creating small C programs and a lot of bash scripts, but the real 'aha' moment came when I discovered Python, I love how easily you can manipulate data in Python and its REPL.
Python became my go-to language for a wide range of tasks, from automating routine processes to crafting intricate data-driven solutions.

As I continued developing my skills, I transitioned from a SysAdmin into a DevOps engineer. One of the pivotal shifts during this phase was my embrace of containerization. I began incorporating containers into my daily workflow using Docker and Podman, and my programming skills to develop CI/CD pipelines to automate deployments.

I can't exactly remember when I first started using Linux, but it was around the time when Ubuntu used to send out CDs of their distribution. I have a screenshot from February 2014 of my former desktop, where I was using [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/). As you can see I was one of the unfortunate individuals who had [Bitcoin](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) on [Mt.Gox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox) back then.

I firmly believe that the learning process is a lifelong commitment, especially in the ever-evolving world of technology. To me, being a great engineer means continually expanding my knowledge and skills.

I’m passionate about problem-solving, and I enjoy the process of digging into issues, reading documentation, testing, and piecing together solutions. That's what keeps me in this field.

Besides technology, I’m all about hiking and outdoor adventures, finding solace in nature. Back home, I like to play Metroidvania games like [Hollow Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Knight) or [Blasphemous](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemous_(video_game)>) and watching a good movie.
