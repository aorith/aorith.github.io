#### Hola! I'm Manuel, a DevOps engineer from Spain

Sometimes, I just want to share about the stuff I do.  
That is the purpose of this blog.

I started out as a pure Linux sysadmin, but over time, Iâ€™ve grown to love crafting things of my own.

Here are some of the things I enjoy:

- Python, Go, [Nix/NixOS](https://nixos.org/), [Neovim](https://github.com/aorith/neovim-flake), tweaking my [dotfiles](https://github.com/aorith/dotfiles) and contributing to opensource when time and skill is on my side
- Playing games like [Hollow Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Knight), [Blasphemous](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemous_(video_game)>) and [Age of Empires II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_II)
- Spending time outdoors with my family and friends

That is all I wanted to tell you :) if you want to reach me, you can do it by using the social links in the footer.
