Hola! I'm Manuel, a Linux enthusiast with a diverse background. From SysAdmin to DevOps engineer, I've evolved into someone who loves to code. While I occasionally tinker with Go, my usual tools of choice are Python and shell scripts.

This journey has helped me bridge the gap between development and operations, allowing me to explore automation and the world of continuous integration.

I'm passionate about problem-solving, and I enjoy the process of digging into issues, reading documentation, testing, and piecing together solutions.

### Containers

Containers are my daily companions for building scalable and efficient applications. With tools like Docker and Podman, and some container orchestration magic, I make sure software deployments go smoothly.

I recall the trials of deploying Python applications into an aging Debian system, battling the dependency hell. It's safe to say that containers have been a beacon of relief in this regard.

### Exploring NixOS and immutable systems

Lately, my interest has been piqued by [Nix/NixOS](https://nixos.org/) and immutable systems. The idea of declarative, reproducible infrastructure and systems management has ignited my curiosity.

Other projects like [bootc](https://github.com/containers/bootc) that aim to bring containers into the Linux desktop have also caught my attention.

### A Quest for Knowledge

In the fast-paced tech world, one thing remains constant: the need to keep learning and stay updated on new technologies. It's an ever-changing landscape, and I'm committed to continuous learning.

### Free Time

Besides technology, I'm all about hiking and outdoor adventures, finding solace in nature. Back home, I like to play Metroidvania games or watching a good movie.
