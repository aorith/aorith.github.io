## Hola!

I'm Manuel, a <abbr title="or whatever title HR is using now">sysadm / platform / devops</abbr> engineer from Spain.

Sometimes, I just want to share about the stuff I do.  
That’s the purpose of this [blog](blog/).

My `$DAYJOB` is at a [CDN](https://www.transparentedge.eu/), where I work with [Varnish](https://www.varnish-software.com/) and/or [Vinyl Cache](https://vinyl-cache.org/) a lot.

### some small projects

- [varnishlog-parser](https://github.com/aorith/varnishlog-parser)
- [cidr-listings](https://github.com/aorith/cidr-listings)
- [neovim-flake](https://github.com/aorith/neovim-flake) (configuring your editor is a project sometimes :D)
