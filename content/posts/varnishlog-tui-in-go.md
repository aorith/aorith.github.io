In the last couple of weeks, I had a lot of fun developing a small terminal user interface application in Go to analyze varnishlog transactions.

> `varnishlog-tui` allows you to inspect varnishlog transactions, find related transactions, generate small reports about them, and organize varnishlog queries.

So, this isn't really a blog post; I just wanted to share the link here :D
